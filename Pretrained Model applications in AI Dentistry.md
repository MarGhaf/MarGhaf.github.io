# Pretrained Models
Pretrained models are neural network models that have already been trained on a large dataset and have learned to extract useful features from the data. These models have already gone through the process of training on large datasets to learn how to extract and recognize patterns, so they can be used as a starting point for developing new machine learning models or for transfer learning.

Pretrained models are typically trained on large datasets such as ImageNet for image classification tasks, and are often available for popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. By using a pretrained model as a starting point, developers can save time and computational resources, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks with less data and training time than if they started from scratch.

# Advantages
Using pretrained models in deep learning can provide several advantages:

- Save time and computational resources: Pretrained models have already been trained on large datasets, so using them as a starting point can save a lot of time and computational resources that would be required to train a model from scratch.

- Better performance: Pretrained models have been trained on large datasets, so they have learned useful features that can be applied to new tasks, resulting in better performance than a model trained from scratch.

- Transfer learning: Pretrained models can be used as a starting point for transfer learning, which involves taking a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it on a new dataset to solve a new problem. Transfer learning can be especially useful when there is limited training data available for a new task.

- Generalization: Pretrained models have learned to generalize well to new data, so they can be used as a starting point for many different tasks.

- Community support: Pretrained models are often part of a larger research community, so there is often support and documentation available to help use and adapt the models for new tasks.

# Disadvantage
There are a few potential disadvantages of using pretrained models:

- Limited applicability: Pretrained models are trained on specific tasks, and may not be directly applicable to other tasks. For example, a model pretrained on image classification may not be useful for object detection or semantic segmentation tasks without additional fine-tuning.

- Computational resources: Pretrained models are often complex and require significant computational resources to run, particularly for large datasets.

- Overfitting: If a pretrained model is fine-tuned on a small dataset, it may overfit to the training data and perform poorly on new data.

- Interpretability: Pretrained models can be difficult to interpret, as the complex layers and high number of parameters can make it challenging to understand how the model is making its predictions.

# Selected Studies on Pre-trained Models in AI Dentistry
There are various pretrained models that have been used in AI dentistry for different tasks. Here are some examples:

- **DeNTNet** is a pre-trained deep learning model for dental image analysis. It is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on a large dataset of dental images to perform various dental image analysis tasks such as caries detection, tooth segmentation, and classification of dental anomalies. DeNTNet was developed by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur and has been shown to achieve high performance on various dental image analysis tasks.In a study published in Scientific Reports, the authors proposed a deep neural transfer network (DeNTNet), for the detection of periodontal bone loss using panoramic dental radiographs. The authors used transfer learning to fine-tune a pretrained VGG16 model on their dataset. They achieved a classification accuracy of 90.7% with the proposed DeNTNet, outperforming other traditional machine learning methods. The authors suggest that DeNTNet can be useful for automated screening and diagnosis of periodontal bone loss in clinical practice [1].

- **ResNet18** is a pretrained CNN model. It was trained on a large dataset of images called ImageNet, which contains over 1 million labeled images. The model was trained to classify images into 1000 different categories, such as "cat," "dog," "car," and "person." However, the weights and parameters of the ResNet18 model can be reused for other computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation, object detection, and feature extraction. In a study published in the Annals of Translational Medicine, the authors proposed a novel approach for the diagnosis of deep caries and pulpitis using CNNs. They developed a deep learning algorithm based on a pre-trained ResNet18 model to analyze digital periapical radiographs for the detection of deep caries and pulpitis. The model was trained on a dataset of 4,800 digital radiographs, and achieved a high accuracy of 98.28% and 97.55% for the diagnosis of deep caries and pulpitis, respectively. The authors concluded that the proposed deep learning approach has the potential to serve as a reliable tool for the diagnosis of dental caries and pulpitis, and could significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of dental radiographic diagnosis [2]. In another study published in Oral Oncology, the authors reviewed the potential of using RestNet for the diagnosis of oral cancer. The authors discussed various AI techniques, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks. They highlighted the potential of AI in improving the accuracy and efficiency of oral cancer diagnosis, particularly in detecting early-stage lesions. The authors also noted the importance of developing large-scale datasets for training and validating AI models and the need for further studies to evaluate the clinical applicability of AI in oral cancer diagnosis [3].

- **VGG16** is a pre-trained model. It was trained on the ImageNet dataset which contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 different classes. The model architecture consists of 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The VGG16 model has been shown to be very effective in image recognition tasks and has been used as a base model for many transfer learning applications. In a recent study published in Displays, researchers proposed an AI assisted method for identifying the therapy history of dental root canals from periapical radiographs. The authors used a pre-trained VGG19  CNN to extract features from the radiographs and then employed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify the images based on the therapy history. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 96.0% in identifying the therapy history from periapical radiographs, demonstrating the potential of AI in assisting dental diagnosis and treatment planning [4].

- **MobileNetV2** is a pretrained model. It is a lightweight CNN architecture designed for mobile and embedded vision applications, where computational resources are limited. The model is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 1 million labeled images and is widely used for pretraining deep neural networks. MobileNetV2 achieves a good balance between model size, accuracy, and inference speed, making it well-suited for deployment on mobile devices or edge devices with limited computing resources. In a study published in the MICCAI Workshop on Medical Image Assisted Biomarkers' Discovery, the authors proposed an AI system for thermographic toothache screening. The system utilized a CNN architecture and was trained on a dataset of thermographic images. The authors employed transfer learning by fine-tuning a pretrained MobileNetV2 model on their dataset, which led to improved accuracy in detecting toothache. The proposed AI system shows potential for non-invasive and efficient toothache screening, which could benefit patients and dental practitioners [5].


- **HRNet** is a pretrained model. HRNet stands for High-Resolution Network, which is a type of neural network architecture designed for high-resolution image classification tasks. It has achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of computer vision benchmarks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and human pose estimation. HRNet is often used as a base architecture for transfer learning, where the network is pretrained on large datasets such as ImageNet and then fine-tuned on smaller datasets for specific tasks. In a study published in the  Journal of Biomedical Optics discusses the development of an automatic system for early detection of oral cancer using smartphone-based images and deep learning techniques. The authors proposed a HRNet CNN based model to detect oral cancer in smartphone images using a dataset of over 10,000 images collected from 119 patients with different oral conditions. The dataset was preprocessed, augmented, and split into training and testing sets. The model was trained using the training set, and then tested on the testing set to evaluate its performance. The results showed that the proposed model achieved high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in detecting oral cancer in smartphone images. The authors believe that the proposed system can be a valuable tool for early detection of oral cancer, especially in low-resource settings where access to specialized medical equipment may be limited. The system can be used by non-expert users, such as primary healthcare providers or patients themselves, to capture images of the oral cavity and get a preliminary assessment of their oral health status.
