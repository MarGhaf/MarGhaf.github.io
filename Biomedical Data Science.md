# Biomedical Data Science
Biomedical sciences are a set of sciences to develop knowledge and technology that practice in healthcare or public health.  Biomedical engineering, medical microbiology, clinical epidemiology, genetic epidemiology, clinical virology, and, etc. are part of biomedical sciences.  Now adays, mathematics, statistics, and bioinformatics are relevant basic sciences that have a pivotal role in biomedical sciences. These basic sciences are tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. 
Biomedical data science is a growing new filed involves the analysis of large-scale biomedical datasets to understand how biologic systems function, disease mechanisms, discover new drugs and improve health care at cheaper costs. 
# Research in Biomedical Data Science
Important scientific fields in Biomedical Data Science include:
- Computational Science

  Using computing technology to address broad questions in personalized medicine.

**DeepMind Technologies** is AI research laboratory acquired by Google. DeepMind turned its AI to predict proteins’ 3D structure. The AlphaFold (protein structure database) builds on decades of studies done by scientists using traditional methods to determine the structure of proteins. Predicting the exact structure of a protein remains an expensive and often time-consuming process. Finding a way to predict the structure of millions of unknown proteins could help us tackle disease and more quickly find new medicines.

AI-based solutions with analyze patient’s symptoms helps to narrow down the diagnosis choices. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have the ability to ‘improve’ and ‘learn’ to recognize patterns of disease features, such as the appearance of breast cancers on mammograms as well as analyzing surrounding textural features. ML algorithms are the perfect "tool" for improved medical diagnostics since they can identify data associations that are "invisible" to the human eye.
