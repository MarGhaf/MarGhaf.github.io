## Introduction
Clinical research are increasingly using regression models. These models are effective analytical tools that produce reliable predictions and allow for studying of statistical inferences. Regression models make two different kinds of assumptions about the response variable's distribution and the form or structure of the connection between the predictors and the answer. In the past medical authors generally used simple linear regression to summarize the data or to calculate the correlation between an independent variable (such as bone mineral density) and a dependent variable (such as ageing) but now machine learing help them to build complecated model based on much larger sample size and more features.These models use to assess therapeutic efficacy, study risk factors, explore prognostic patterns, and derive predictions for individual patients. Multiple regresion, logistic regression, and effects  regression models are common regression models that have been used in clinical studies. In the following, a number of researches in this field will be discussed. 

## Multiple Regresion Model
Multiple regression is a statistical technique that can be used to analyze the relationship between a single dependent variable and several independent variables. The objective of multiple regression analysis is to use the independent variables whose values are known to predict the value of the single dependent value.




## Logistic Regression Model
In statistics, a logistic regression model describes and estimates the relationship between one binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  Logistic regression models are versatile, and have been used to describe phenomena in diverse areas of medical and nonmedical research. Zabor et al. (2022) [1] in a recent review disscused the application of logistic regression model in clinical studies. They conclued that logistic regression is powerful to evaluate although some significant errors might present. The assessments and other decisions made during model building must be thoroughly described in the final report. The choice of variables is also important. In a study  Aoyama et al. [2] have deleloped a multivariable logistic regression model to study a risk of developing an intracranial hemorrhage because of  pregnancy-induced hypertension in patients. They conclued that : 'The importance of choosing appropriate variables for a regression model
is highlighted, underscoring the need to ensure that the baseline assumptions of a selected model are correct and to assess model performance and your confidence in the results as derived from regression analyses'. 


## Effect Regression Model
Effect Model is a statistical model in which some of the parameters that define systematic components of the model exhibit some form of variations.can be conducted in three forms. In random-effects models, some of these systematic effects are considered random.In fixed-effects models, the systematic effects are considered fixed or nonrandom. And,  models that include both fixed and random effects may be called mixed-effects models.
In a recent study, Arsène et al. (2022) [3] developed an epidemiological model of respiratory tract infection (RTI) coupled to a mechanistic description of viral RTI episodes in silico clinical trial based on effects model. The model advocates reporting a variety of metrics for benefits assessment, using adaptive trial design and adapted statistical analyses.
