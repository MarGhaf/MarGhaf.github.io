# Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of intelligence exhibited by animals and humans that processed by machines. With proper training, AI can perform tasks with greater precision and accuracy than humans. AI can be classified in many ways. The term AI encompasses different categories such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). Each category has different applications and associated algorithms that provide different results. Types of AI was summarized in fig 1.
