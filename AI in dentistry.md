# Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of intelligence exhibited by animals and humans that processed by machines. With proper training, AI can perform tasks with greater precision and accuracy than humans. AI can be classified in many ways. The term AI encompasses different categories such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). Each category has different applications and associated algorithms that provide different results. Types of AI was summarized in fig 1.

AI systems have the potential to reform the fields of medicine  by identifying solutions that address multiple clinical problems that make the work of clinicians easier. It has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine by improving the accuracy, speed, and efficiency of various medical tasksAI search in health care can be divide into two types virtual and robotic (fig. 1). The virtual type deals with mathematical algorithms and robotic type support physical part of healthcare systems. The application of AI in dentistry is not common. However, the advent of these technologies has impacted imaging and pathology, dental radiology, caries detection, electronic record keeping, and robotic assistance.

Some examples of how AI is being used in medicine include:
1.	Diagnosis: AI algorithms can analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, to identify abnormalities and make a diagnosis.
2.	Predictive analytics: AI can analyze large amounts of data, including electronic health records and genetic information, to predict the likelihood of certain medical conditions or outcomes.
3.	Personalized medicine: AI can help to tailor treatment plans to individual patients by analyzing their medical history and genetic makeup.
4.	Drug discovery: AI can analyze chemical compounds and predict their potential effectiveness as drugs, speeding up the drug discovery process.
5.	Clinical decision support: AI can provide doctors with real-time recommendations based on the latest medical evidence and guidelines.
Overall, AI has the potential to improve patient care and reduce the burden on healthcare systems by automating routine tasks and enabling doctors to focus on more complex and challenging cases. However, it is important to note that AI is not a replacement for human expertise, and its use in medicine should always be guided by ethical principles.

# AI in dentistry
Dentistry is a branch of medicine that focuses on the health of the teeth and mouth. Dentists are medical professionals who are trained to diagnose, prevent, and treat a variety of conditions and diseases that affect the teeth and mouth. These may include cavities, gum disease, and other infections, as well as problems with the bite, jaw, and facial structure. Dentists also perform a variety of procedures, such as filling cavities, extracting teeth, and placing crowns and bridges. In addition to providing clinical care, dentists may also educate patients on how to maintain good oral hygiene and prevent dental problems. There are several branches of dentistry that focus on specific areas of the mouth and teeth. Some of the main branches of dentistry include:

- Orthodontics: This branch of dentistry deals with the alignment of the teeth and jaw, and involves the use of braces, retainers, and other devices to correct misalignment and improve the appearance of the teeth.

- Periodontics: This branch focuses on the health of the gums and the tissues that support the teeth. Periodontists diagnose and treat gum disease and may also perform procedures such as gum grafts and bone regeneration to restore the health of the gums and support structures.

- Endodontics: This branch focuses on the inside of the teeth, specifically the pulp and the nerves. Endodontists perform procedures such as root canals to treat infections and injuries to the pulp and nerves.

- Prosthodontics: This branch deals with the replacement of missing teeth and the repair of damaged teeth. Prosthodontists may create and place crowns, bridges, and dentures to restore the appearance and function of the teeth.

- Pediatric dentistry: This branch focuses on the oral health of children and adolescents. Pediatric dentists are specially trained to provide dental care for children, including preventive care and treatments for common dental problems.

- Oral and maxillofacial surgery: This branch involves the surgical treatment of problems related to the mouth, teeth, and facial structures. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons may perform procedures such as wisdom tooth extractions and jaw surgery.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in a variety of ways in the field of dentistry, including:
1.	Diagnosis: AI algorithms can analyze dental images, such as X-rays and 3D scans, to identify abnormalities and make a diagnosis.
2.	Treatment planning: AI can analyze patient data and medical images to create customized treatment plans for procedures such as orthodontics and implant placement.
3.	Predictive analytics: AI can analyze large amounts of data, including electronic health records and patient history, to predict the likelihood of certain dental conditions or outcomes.
4.	Patient communication: AI-powered chatbots can assist with patient communication by answering common questions and providing information about treatment options.
5.	Clinical decision support: AI can provide dentists with real-time recommendations based on the latest dental evidence and guidelines.
Overall, AI has the potential to improve patient care and reduce the burden on dental practices by automating routine tasks and enabling dentists to focus on more complex and challenging cases. However, it is important to note that AI is not a replacement for human expertise, and its use in dentistry should always be guided by ethical principles.

## Diagnosis (Dental Radiology)
Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly machine learning algorithms, are increasingly being used in the field of radiology to assist with diagnosis. Some of the most commonly used AI algorithms in radiology include:

- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): These are a type of neural network that are particularly effective at analyzing images and are commonly used in medical imaging for tasks such as segmentation and classification.

- Deep learning: This is a type of machine learning that involves the use of multi-layered neural networks to analyze large datasets and make predictions. Deep learning algorithms are often used in radiology to analyze medical images and assist with diagnosis.

- Natural language processing (NLP): This is a type of AI that is used to analyze and interpret human language. In radiology, NLP algorithms may be used to extract information from radiology reports and other medical documents.

- Decision trees: This is a type of machine learning algorithm that involves creating a flowchart-like tree of decisions, with each branch representing a possible outcome. Decision trees may be used in radiology to assist with diagnosis by analyzing a set of input features and predicting the most likely diagnosis based on those features.

- Support vector machines (SVMs): This is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used to classify data points by finding the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates the points into different categories. SVMs are often used in medical imaging to classify different types of abnormalities or lesions.

It's important to note that AI algorithms are typically used to assist with diagnosis, rather than replacing the role of a radiologist. AI can help radiologists analyze images more efficiently and accurately, but the final diagnosis is still made by the radiologist based on their expertise and knowledge.
