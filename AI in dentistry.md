# Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of intelligence exhibited by animals and humans that processed by machines. With proper training, AI can perform tasks with greater precision and accuracy than humans. AI can be classified in many ways. The term AI encompasses different categories such as machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). Each category has different applications and associated algorithms that provide different results. Types of AI was summarized in fig 1.

AI systems have the potential to reform the fields of medicine and dentistry by identifying solutions that address multiple clinical problems that make the work of clinicians easier. AI search in health care can be divide into two types virtual and robotic (fig. 1). The virtual type deals with mathematical algorithms and robotic type support physical part of healthcare systems. The application of AI in dentistry is not common. However, the advent of these technologies has impacted imaging and pathology, dental radiology, caries detection, electronic record keeping, and robotic assistance.
